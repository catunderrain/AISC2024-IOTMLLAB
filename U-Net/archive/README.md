## What is Peripheral Blood Smear?

A peripheral blood smear is a thin layer of blood smeared on a glass microscope slide and then stained in such a way as to allow the various blood cells to be examined microscopically. Blood films are examined in the investigation of hematological (blood) disorders and are routinely employed to look for blood parasites, such as those of malaria and filariasis. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film))

Examination of the peripheral blood smear is an inexpensive but powerful diagnostic tool in both children and adults. In some ways it is becoming a "lost art" but it often provides rapid, reliable access to information about a variety of hematologic disorders. The smear offers a window into the functional status of the bone marrow, the factory producing all blood elements. It is particularly important when assessing cytopenic states (eg, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia). Review of the smear is an important adjunct to other clinical data; in some cases, the peripheral smear alone is sufficient to establish a diagnosis.
